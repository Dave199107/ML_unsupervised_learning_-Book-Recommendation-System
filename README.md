# ML_unsupervised_learning_-Book-Recommendation-System
During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives.
Recommender systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. As a proof of the importance of recommender systems, we can mention that, a few years ago, Netflix organised a challenges (the “Netflix prize”) where the goal was to produce a recommender system that performs better than its own algorithm with a prize of 1 million dollars to win.

By applying this simple dataset and related tasks and notebooks , we will evolutionary go through different paradigms of recommender algorithms . For each of them, we will present how they work, describe their theoretical basis and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.
